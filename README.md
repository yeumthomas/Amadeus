# Welcome to Amadeus!

Amadeus was built to mitigate the strain of editing virtual orchestral performances. 
Due to COVID-19, orchestras have had to resort to the virtual orchestra format, which cost on average $1000 per recording to edit by hiring a video editor.

Amadeus replaces that editor with an intuitive, equitable platform so music directors can save their time and budgets.

Amadeus was built with Ffmpeg, a flagship video and audio editing library, and Vue.JS.
